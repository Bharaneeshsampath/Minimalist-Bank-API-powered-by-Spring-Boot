Project Title: Minimalist Bank API Powered by Spring Boot

Project Description:

The Minimalist Bank API powered by Spring Boot is a backend application designed to offer fundamental banking functionalities through a RESTful API. It provides a streamlined approach to managing bank accounts, enabling users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and delete accounts as necessary. Built using the Spring Boot framework, the project emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and reliability.

Key Features:

Account Creation: Users can create bank accounts by providing essential information such as name, email, and initial deposit amount. Upon successful creation, each account is assigned a unique identifier.

Deposit Funds: Account holders can deposit funds into their accounts by specifying the account ID and the amount to be deposited. The API ensures the integrity and security of transactions, updating the account balance accordingly.

Withdraw Funds: Account holders can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided they have sufficient balance. Similar to the deposit functionality, users need to specify the account ID and the amount to be withdrawn. The API validates the withdrawal request and updates the account balance accordingly.

Delete Account: Users have the option to delete their bank accounts if needed. This functionality requires providing the account ID for identification purposes. Upon successful deletion, the associated account data is removed from the system.

Technology Stack:

Spring Boot: Provides a robust and flexible framework for building RESTful APIs, simplifying the development process and enhancing productivity.

Java: Utilized as the primary programming language for developing the application logic, leveraging its versatility and object-oriented features.

RESTful API: Implemented to enable communication between the client applications and the server, ensuring interoperability and scalability.

Data Persistence: Utilized mechanisms such as JDBC or Spring Data JPA to interact with the underlying database, facilitating data storage and retrieval operations.MySQL is used as the database management system for data storage.

Project Goals:

Simplicity: The primary goal of the project is to provide a minimalist yet functional API for basic banking operations, prioritizing ease of use and straightforwardness.

Reliability: The application aims to deliver reliable and consistent performance, ensuring that transactions are processed accurately and efficiently.

Scalability: While designed with minimalism in mind, the project architecture allows for scalability to accommodate potential future enhancements and increased user demand.

Conclusion:

The Minimalist Bank API powered by Spring Boot serves as a foundational backend solution for banking operations, offering essential functionalities in a straightforward and efficient manner. With its focus on simplicity and reliability, the project provides a robust platform for managing bank accounts and facilitating transactions, catering to the needs of both developers and end-users alike.
